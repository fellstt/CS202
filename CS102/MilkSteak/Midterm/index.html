                    This seems straightforward, although sometimes it can be difficult to decide what should be listed and what should be left out. It is really the artist's choice how detailed they would like to be. For example, you can list your medium as simply as possible for example, oil on linen. You can include more detail, if you feel it is integral to the work for example, gel medium, tea, sand, dirt, grass on found canvas. Should you be selling your work and you would like to include a price on your label, place it at the bottom. If the work is not for sale, you can leave this area blank. If the work is loaned, this is where you would credit the lender. For example, Courtesy of Cleopatra.
